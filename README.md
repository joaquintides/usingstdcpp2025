[Push is Faster](https://github.com/joaquintides/usingstdcpp2025/raw/main/Push%20is%20faster.pdf):
Push and pull are the two main paradigms when it comes to data processing. In this talk, we'll discuss both approaches
from an abstract point of view, compare them for expressivity and efficiency, review some prominent C++ examples
and propose a push-based approach that outperforms C++ ranges, sometimes by a wide margin.
We end the talk by discussing how coroutines blur the boundaries between push and pull and what it would take for them
to be a compelling option for high-performance data processing.
